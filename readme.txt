This project simulates a firewall checking packets. Packets are generated by packetsources and distributed among wait-free queues by a dispatcher thread. Worker threads assigned to each queue take the packets and calculate their checksum. The purpose of this project was to compare the performance of a parallel implentation vs a serial implementation which is reflected in nthe tests.

to run tests first
make queue
make packets

then
python3 tester.py
